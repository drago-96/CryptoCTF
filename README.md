# CryptoCTF 2019

This repository contains some commented solutions of the CTF held at https://cryp.toc.tf; the main theme was criptography and number theory.

I took part on this CCTF with the Italian team pwnthem0le, and we arrived 9th.

In this repository there are some revised solutions to the problems I solved during the competition, and maybe to the other problems when and if I will solve them.

The solutions are all in Sage Jupyter notebooks, apart from Aron (which is a python script).
